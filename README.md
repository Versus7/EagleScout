# EagleScout
Note: Development of this repository has paused as a new version is in the works. Check out [EagleScout](https://github.com/EagleScoutDev/EagleScout) for the latest version.

## What is this?
This is a proof-of-concept app that demonstrates how Team 114 (aka "Eaglestrike") could scout on iOS devices. This was created to try and improve the experience for our scouters, who typically use our scouting website on their phones. The questions inside are for the FRC 2022 Game *Rapid React*.


## Features
* Save scouting reports offline
* Google SSO (work in progress)
* Aggregates team data in a dedicated "robot profile" section.
* Improve the scouter experience
    * The UI for this app was designed with one goal in mind: minimizing the amount of time a scouter needs to look at the device while scouting. Watching the match is more interesting than struggling to input data, so we tried to optimize the UI with this in mind.
    * The app also has Quality of Life features for scouters, like the ability to start a timer to track how long a robot is dead on the field for, or how long it takes to climb.
    
## What's next?
* Team 114 is working on building an entirely new software suite for scouting.
* We hope to release this to other teams for their own use soon.
* This repository will be updated with the link as soon as our new software is released to the public.
